**Aim** To carry out the widal test for the given bloo antibodies against salmonella antigens.

**Theory And Principle** Widal test is a serological test which is used f fever. Typhoid or enteric fever is caused by a (_Salmonella_ Typhi or _Salmonella_ Paratyphi). wall and H antigen on their flagella.
